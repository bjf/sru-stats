# sru-stats

This project refers to the Ubuntu Kernel SRU Cycle. The idea behind the tools in this project are to gather data about the SRU Cycle process with the goals of understanding how the process is working and where time is spent along the pipeline that is used to produce Ubuntu kernel updates.

## Tools

<div style="margin-left; 40px;">
